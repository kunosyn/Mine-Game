# Mine Game
Mine Game is a personal project of mine based off of a Google Drawing game my friends and I used to play at school.
This project is reimagining the game mechanics and making it actually playable in the form of a Computer Game.

## Testing
If you want to test this game, there are a few things you'll need to do.

- Copy the Textures folder to the build directory.
- Install [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite/blob/master/Cpp/FastNoiseLite.h).
- Change the LibraryDirectory variable to the Directory of FastNoiseLite in CMakeLists.txt.

## W.I.P
This game is a huge WIP. What does that mean?
This means that portions of the code may be hugely unoptimized, uncessary, or generally subject to change.
